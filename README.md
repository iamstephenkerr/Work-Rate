Work-Rate
=========

An iOS application.

This is a simple time tracking application designed to help you manage your time spend working on different projects.

The application has two different projects available:
- Multi task
- Single task

The multi-task project consists of multiple projects and they all total up to a final figure.
The single task is simply one task.

The application also allows the user to send a HTML formatted invoice representing when the user worked and a total cost to charge the client.
The invoice is quite detailed and even allows you to change the currency (Euro, Pounds, Dollars) and set the tax rate.

The application is available on the iOS App store.
